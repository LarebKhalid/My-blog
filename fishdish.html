    <h3>Fish Dish</h3>
     
     <p>
     
        
        I come from Lahore, one of the largest cities of Pakistan and famous for its cuisine and hospitality. Nihari (beef stew), Biryani(rice and chicken cooked together), Halwa Poori (deep fried tortillas), and Lahori Fried Fish are the most common dishes of Lahore. Lahori Fried Fish is the queen of all the dishes during winter. Typically, it is deep fried Rohu Fish cut into hand sized pieces, coated in dozens of spices and dipped in gram flour batter before taking a hot shower in hot oil. Most importantly it is fried with its skin on as it gets extra crispy and tastes heavenly.
        Growing up, I never liked having fried fish for a number of reasons. Firstly, it was cut along its spine to retain its shape during the cooking process. That made it really difficult to remove bones from the meat. Secondly, I hated its typical fish smell. Thirdly, it took a long time to cook properly. 
        Fast forward to the time when I moved to Sweden 11 years ago. One day, my husband proposed the idea of having fish for dinner. Right away I started protesting against this proposal as I literally hated fish for its smell mostly. My husband somehow convinced me to try Salmon for the very first time. So this was my first encounter with this fish meal that later became my favourite fish dish. This fish looked and tasted entirely different from the one I used to have in my home country. Easy to cut and easy to make. Salmon also known as Lax is used quite commonly in Sweden as a part of main course.
            The most mesmerising experience I remember was a dinner that I ordered for myself on a cruise to Helsinki. It consisted of pan fried Salmon with creamy sauce and baked potatoes. The fish was fried in a manner that it did not lose its beautiful pinkish colour as the meat usually does after getting cooked. Although, the edges of the perfectly cut rectangular slices of Salmon were brown and crispy. The texture was medium: neither too hard like beef nor too that might scatter in the plate as you try to take a bite. Just the right kind of medium soft that I could easily shred with the fork. On top of it was creamy sauce drizzled beautifully in waves like patterns just like the advertisement of moisturisers in which the audience can see the texture of the moisturiser in a fully zoomed in view flowing in slow motion. I could also see streaks of oil in the sauce due to the presence of butter in the sauce along with tiny particles of black pepper. Fresh dill sat on the top of the pile. Besides this pile, whole baked baby potatoes were lying peacefully on the side of the fish. The whole plate made a beautiful combination of pink, green, off white and slightly brown.
            The aroma was a fusion of typical fish odour and fresh dill fragrance. As soon as I took a bite the salted taste of creamy sauce along with grassy and licorice flavour of dill with shredded salmon felt heavenly in my mouth. Then came the baked potatoes whose texture was soft. I devoured the meal watching a beautiful sunset while cruising the Baltic sea.
