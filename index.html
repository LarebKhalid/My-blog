        <a>Stress Management</a>
        <p>Stress Management
            The term ‘stress’ was introduced by Hans Hugo Bruno Selye’ in the 1920’s and since then,  stress has been defined in many ways. In simplest words it is a chemical change that takes place in our body during uncontrollable circumstances. It has also been named flight or fight mode to respond to such uncontrollable circumstances. Stress is not always a result of traumatic happenings in our life. There are many overlooked stress factors in our daily life such as work life imbalance, too many or conflicting responsibilities, student life stress, and workload, etc. One of the most overlooked stress factors is the overuse of technology today. Where modern tech has made our lives easier than before, it has also increased the momentum of our life. Nowadays, we hardly spend any time without tech gadgets. Consequently, we have become addicted to technology to the point that it starts interfering with our relaxation. This essay explores the presence of modern tech in our lives that accumulates mental health issues. 
                Smartphones are the most common technological equipment used today. Where they have facilitated our lives by combining multiple features in one device, we have also become dependent upon them. Studies have shown that since 2010 there has been a sharp increase in mental health issues among adolescents in the USA, UK and Canada. There have been depressive episodes among adolescents along with anxiety disorders and suicidal thoughts. “There is a growing consensus that the decline in mental health may be linked instead to the increasing popularity of smartphones and social media around this same time.” (Twenge 20) Today’s generation is dependent upon smartphones consequently, they spend most of the time looking at the screen. This increased screen time causes headache, migraines, insomnia etc among adolescents. ‘High level of screen time exposure has been linked to migraine in young adults’(Montagni Ilaria et al). Due to these problems, adolescents fail to focus on their goals and as a result they go deeper into depression. This shows that smartphones are a cause of mental health issues among adolescents. 
                Technology is everywhere and we are becoming increasingly dependent upon technical devices such as tablets, Ipads, smartphones, smartwatches, and laptops etc. These devices have given access to a number of tasks that we perform today for example we are always checking our emails, shopping online, checking social media, listening and watching to music videos, ordering food etc. We cannot stay away from these devices for long. Think about the moment when you forget your mobile phone or smart watch at home; anxiety takes over and we cannot concentrate on our work. Consequently the constant beeps and vibrations from these devices distract us in a number of ways. As a result, we lack focus and keep switching our attention between multiple tasks. Thus consolidation of thoughts in our brain becomes difficult. This shows that axcess use of technology causes poor cognitive skills that consequently leads to stress due to uncompleted tasks. 
            It cannot be denied that these advancements in technology have facilitated our life in a number of ways. For example, we can access news from around the world while sitting in our living room. Similarly, our communication has been facilitated in a number of ways. Our friends and family in other countries are one phone call away from us. Specially, sms and instant messaging through platforms like Whatsapp and Messenger has made our communication easier. However, there is a fine line between useful and useless contacts. Since, these platforms have provided unlimited talk time, people waste a good amount of time in constant messaging and chatting. On the other hand, this is not an effective way of communication. Firstly, sometimes it gets difficult to analyze what that other person is trying to say. Secondly, constant messaging makes us forget people sitting around us. Consequently, we cut ourselves from the real world and become socially isolated. Thus, there should be a borderline between use and abuse of these devices in terms of communication. 
            In conclusion, this essay highlights that technology has improved our lives in a variety of ways but this improvement has a dark side as well. Involving ourselves too much into these technological improvements leads to a number of mental health problems that are overlooked by our society. We are in need of reevaluating our time spent on smart devices in order to avoid mental health problems.
